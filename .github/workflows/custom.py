# This script runs a baseline scan against a target URL using ZAP
#
# It can either be run 'standalone', in which case depends on
# https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-owasp-zap-v2.4 and Docker, or it can be run
# inside one of the ZAP docker containers. It automatically detects if it is
# running in docker so the parameters are the same.
#
# By default it will spider the target URL for one minute, but you can change
# that via the -m parameter.
# It will then wait for the passive scanning to finish - how long that takes
# depends on the number of pages found.
# It will exit with codes of:
#	0:	Success
#	1:	At least 1 FAIL
#	2:	At least one WARN and no FAILs
#	3:	Any other failure
# By default all alerts found by ZAP will be treated as WARNings.
# You can use the -c or -u parameters to specify a configuration file to override
# this.
# You can generate a template configuration file using the -g parameter. You will
# then need to change 'WARN' to 'FAIL', 'INFO' or 'IGNORE' for the rules you want
# to be handled differently.
# You can also add your own messages for the rules by appending them after a tab
# at the end of each line.
